## Project 01: 2D Diffuse Shading & Specular Highlight with Normal Maps

**Goal**: To learn basics of Diffuse Shading.

**Synopsis**: The first project is intended for you to start with a simple 2D diffuse shader. You will use simple objects in 2D using normal map to shade such as the ones provided in class Google drive.

**Project Requirement**:: Your grade for this project will be computed based on completed tasks (each task has the same weight):

Simple Rendering with diffuse reflection by using 2D shapes defined by normal maps. There will be two types of diffuse rendering: (1) mixing two dark and light colors; and (2) mixing dark and light images; (2 tasks)
Simple Rendering with diffuse reflection and specular highlight by using 2D shapes defined by normal maps. There will be three types of shaders: (1) mixing one dark and one light color with specular color; and (2) mixing dark and light images with specular color (Reflective region should be defined by a ks parameter that can be given as either as alpha or a separate image) (2 tasks)
There are total of 4 tasks. There will be at least 4 images/animations rendered and uploaded to class website. Spherical shapes are there to demonstrate that your program is working. If a task is completed after the target date, you will get %50 grade of the late completed task.
